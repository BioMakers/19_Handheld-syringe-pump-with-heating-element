# Synopsis

We are constructing a handheld syringe pump with an included heating element for microfluidic applications. An Arduino is used as the central controlling element. It adjusts the temperature via a mantle-type heating element wrapped around the syringe, and sets the flow rate and target volume by regulating the rotation of a stepper motor. The settings can be changed and parameters displayed with an interactive touchscreen. A 3D-printed structure is used making the device light, inexpensive, and easy to replicate. The temperature control provides a novel feature, making the device an ideal tool for microfluidic cell culture applications.

# Hardware documentation and part list

The device is powered by a 12 V power supply. All the components which draw a lot of power (i.e., the Arduino, the stepper motor and the heating element) were chosen so that they can work with that exact voltage. The power supply simply has to be powerful enough to handle the current, so we chose a 60W power supply which should be easily enough.
The mechanics for withdrawing and infusing the syringe rely on the following open-source project: http://www.appropedia.org/Open-source_syringe_pump. One can download the parts for printing here: https://www.youmagine.com/designs/syringe-pump.

The heating element comprises of a temperature sensor (TMP36, connected to 5V, GROUND and Analog In 0 on the Arduino) and a 12 V kapton heating element. The power send to the heating element can be controlled using the analog output 5 of the Arduino and a transistor (TIP 120), which opens the channel between Collector and Emittor when the analog output of the Arduino is HIGH. A resistor is inserted between the Arduino and the Base of the transistor to protect it from too high currents. Due to the PWM nature of the analog output of the Arduino, the transistor rapidly switches between ON and OFF states thus effectively creating analog states from 0 (0% heating power) to 255 (100% heating power).

The 12V bipolar stepper motor for controlling the liquid flow is driven by the Big Easy Driver (http://www.schmalzhaus.com/BigEasyDriver/) and controlled via the digital outputs 2 (connected to STEP) and 3 (connected to DIRection) of the Arduino.

# Code documentation

## 4D touchpad
The code used to interact with the touchscreen is programmed with Workshop using Visi Genie (http://www.4dsystems.com.au/product/4D_Workshop_4_IDE/). The main file "syringepump.4DGenie" and the supplementary files containing images and the keyboard layouts in the folder "syringepump.ImgData" are uploaded to the 4D touchscreen.

## Arduino

The code in "SyringePump.ino" is uploaded to the Arduino.

### Interaction with 4D Systems touchpad
The ViSi-Genie-Arduino Library is necessary to send information via a serial port (souch as flow rate, the set point for the temperature, the current temperature, etc.) between the Arduino and the 4D touchpad, see https://github.com/4dsystems/ViSi-Genie-Arduino-Library.

### PID controller
The temperature control uses a PID algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller), which has been implemented in this library: https://github.com/br3ttb/Arduino-PID-Library/.
